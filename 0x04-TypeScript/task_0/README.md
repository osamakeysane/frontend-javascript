# Task 0 - Creating an Interface for a Student

This task is part of the **0x04-TypeScript** project.

## Objective
The goal of this task is to:
- Define a `Student` interface in TypeScript.
- Create an array `studentsList` containing at least 2 student objects.
- Render the students in a table (`<table>`) using Vanilla JavaScript, with each student's information displayed in its own row.

## Files
- `js/main.ts` → Contains:
  - The `Student` interface.
  - The `studentsList` array.
  - The code to generate a `<table>` dynamically with the student data.
- `README.md` → This file.

## Example
The generated HTML table should look like this (with example data):

| First Name | Last Name | Age | Location |
|------------|-----------|-----|----------|
| John       | Doe       | 21  | Nairobi  |
| Jane       | Smith     | 22  | Mombasa  |

## Requirements
- Code must be written in **TypeScript**.
- Compiled JavaScript is placed in the `js` folder.
- Must run without errors.
